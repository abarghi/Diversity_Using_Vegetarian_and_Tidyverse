# A Tidyverse Approach to Alpha, Beta and Gamma Diversities

Alpha, beta and gamma diversities are computed and visualized using formulas and using the R package `vegetarian`. The document uses the data set `vegetarian::simesants`. For the formulas used in this document, see the following articles: 
- L. Jost, “Entropy and diversity”, Oikos, vol. 113, pp. 363–375, Jan. 2006. 
- L. Jost, “Partitioning diversity into independent alpha and beta components”, Ecology, vol. 88, pp. 2427–2439, Oct. 2008.

The repository contains a Jupyter notebook (`.ipynb`) and an RMarkdown file (`.rmd`).
