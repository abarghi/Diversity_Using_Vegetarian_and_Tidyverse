# A Tidyverse Approach to Alpha, Beta and Gamma Diversities

Alpha, beta and gamma diversities are computed and visualized using formulas and using the package vegetarian. The document uses the data set vegetarian::simesants. For the formulas used in this document, see the following articles: 
- L. Jost, “Entropy and diversity”, Oikos, vol. 113, pp. 363–375, Jan. 2006. 
- L. Jost, “Partitioning diversity into independent alpha and beta components”, Ecology, vol. 88, pp. 2427–2439, Oct. 2008.
